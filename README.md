### Vintage eCommerce 

Vintage eCommerce is a fully functional eCommerce webpage created with React, Commerce js, and Stripe. 
It is set to testing so no sales are actually made, but you can checkout with an order using the testing

### What I Learned

I learned a about building an app using Material-UI's components and React-Router to traverse the different web pages.
How to host a store with Commerce js and utilize the API they create to store and retrieve product data and the users cart
and shipping data. I also learned how to use React-Hook-Form to capture and store user form input and learned how to implement 
Stripe to process online payments. Overall this project was a challenge but I had a lot of fun working on it and learning how to
create a fully functional online store front.
